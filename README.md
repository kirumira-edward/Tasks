# Tasks
Task manager lite app
Clone the repository and create a separate branch named by your name.

Goals

- Implement a minimal Task Manager:
  - Backend endpoints:
    - GET /tasks → list tasks
    - POST /tasks → create task
      {title: str, done: bool}
    - PUT /tasks/{id} → update title/done
    - DELETE /tasks/{id} → delete task
  - Frontend features:
    - Add new tasks
    - List tasks from backend
    - Mark done/undone, edit title, delete
    - UI updates without page reload
- Write unit tests for your code.

You may refactor structure, add files, and improve the UX. Keep it simple, readable, and well-tested.
